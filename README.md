## features descriptions :

**Project Structure**
- `main.go`: Entry point of the CLI application.
- `root.go`: A very important file in whitch createCmd variable is init.

**Prompts commands**
- `prompts/prompts.go`: the creation of a prompts starts here in a named function.
- `cmd/create.go`: to use your prompt functions, have a look into the runCreate function.


## How does it work ??? 


**Launch commands**
- `init()`: is the first function executed before main().
It adds the content of `createCmd` to the content of `rootCmd` by the cobra method `AddCommand()`
To add more commands to le CLI, its the place where you must had them.

- `main()`: is the second function executed after `init()`.
It lauches the `Execute()` cobra function.

- `Execute()`: is a methode from cobra library.
It reads what is after the instruction `archi` and run the right function.
(exemple : Use = command name, RunE = function to execute)



**Create workflow**
- `runCreate()`: Execute a list of function that manage prompts, stock the results, and execute the result.

*Prompts :*
1 - `PromptProjectName()`
2 - `PromptArchitecture()`
3 - `PromptLanguage()`
4 - `PromptExpress()`

It stores the result of each prompt in an object `config` to use it into the last function to create the project `GenerateProject()`

*Execution :*
1 - `RunNpmInit()`
2 - `InstallDependencies()`
3 - `InstallPnpm()`

**Project Generation**
- `GenerateProject()`: is the main function that manage the whole creation of folders `createDirectoryStructure()` and base files `generateBaseFiles()`

- `createDirectoryStrucure()`: is calling the template function choose by the user and create them `CreateDirectory()`

- `generateBaseFile()`: is calling the template function to create base file with  `WriteFile()`
